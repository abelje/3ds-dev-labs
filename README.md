# 3ds Development Tests
This is a small project to see what it takes to develop of the 3ds through 3ds homebrew. I am assuming that people looking at this already have a modded 3ds or access to a emulator like Azahar. More information on modding a 3ds can be found at this website: [https://3ds.hacks.guide/](https://3ds.hacks.guide/). They have a great walkthrough on how to softmod your 3ds console.

## Goals
My main goals for this project is to:
- Get a feel for 3ds development and what is possible
- Create simple programs to explore what I can do with the 3ds hardware
- Create a game of some sort

## Projects
